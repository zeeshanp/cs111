UCLA CS111 LAB 1

Usage:

	./timetrash [-pt] [FILE]

	-p    Prints out command tree's.
	-t    Executes commands in parallel.

Implementation Details:
	1a:
	 In order to implement lab1a, we first tokenized the
	 entire input file, getting rid of any spaces or 
	 comments. After, we used two stacks to form a postorder 
	 of any commands and their arguments. Using this post order,
	 we were able to construct each command tree.
	1b: 
	 For lab 1b, we iterated through the command tree recursively.
	 Once we reached a simple command, we opened the correct
	 file descriptors and then executed the command. For pipes,
	 we chose to have the main process be the parent process, with
	 the rhs as a child and the lhs as grandchild.
	1c:
	 For lab 1c, we execute the commands in parallel by first 
	 determining which commands have the following data hazards:
	 Read after Write, Write after Write, and Write after Read.
	 Once we determined these commands, we launched processes to 
	 first execute all independent commands, and once race conditions
	 had been resolved, execute the dependent commands.
		



KNOWN ERRORS:
-Our shell does not handle subshell redirects properly, 
 the script (a && b) > c.txt will give a syntax error.
-The command `sleep` does not work if it is the first 
 command in a file. It works anywhere else.
